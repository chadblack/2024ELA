# required readings

There is on text required for purchase:

All other required readings are available on Canvas.

# in-class writing (30%)[¶](https://chadblack.net/2023MLA/assignments/#in-class-writing-30 "Permanent link")

Occasionally, at the end of class, you will be asked to write a short paragraph on the day’s or week’s readings.  You get two free misses for any reason whatsoever. But this also means that any misses over two will count regardless of excuses. In other words, don’t do what some have in the past: skip two classes and then get sick for a third, because that third miss will count. You may use one page of handwritten notes for in-class writing. For more on how to take notes while reading, see [[255_ELA/2024ELA/docs/resources/an approach to making notes|an approach to making notes]].

# in-class exams (25% each)[¶](https://chadblack.net/2023MLA/assignments/#in-class-exams-20-each "Permanent link")

There will be two exams- a midterm and final.

# film reaction (20%)[¶](https://chadblack.net/2023MLA/assignments/#film-reaction-15 "Permanent link")

We have two feature length film options this semester, [_La Otra Conquista_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0175996/) and [_Zama_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3409848/). Students must write a 3-5 page analysis on one of these films, the first which treats the question of the spiritual conquest of Nahuatl civilization, and second of which treats the vanity, ambition, and capriciousness of late colonial rule.

Instructions for the _La Otra Conquista_ version of this assignment: [[255_ELA/2024ELA/docs/resources/La otra conquista|La otra conquista]].
